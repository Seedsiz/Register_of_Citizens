Welcome to the Mage Book interface!

What it does/has: 

1)Gives number of how many people are in WE.
2)Lists all people in the world currently.
3)Checks if a person is registered in the database(active and inative both).
-Prints out information about requested character: Name + fandom + what type of character they are.
-Catches invalid requests and repeats question.
-Easter egg question on life.

Features to add eventually:
-Tell when a character first arrived.
-Sims/children as subclass of people and so they can be linked to parents. (Interface?)
-Add more easter eggs!
-Find out if/when/how many times a requested character has been in the world before.
-Tell how many days it has been since an active character arrived.
