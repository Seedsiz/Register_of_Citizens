-Catches invalid requests and repeats question.

-Easter egg!

-Tell how many days it has been since an active character arrived.

-Now with a reservation list!


Features to add eventually:

-Tell when a character first arrived.

-Sims/children as subclass of people and so they can be linked to parents. (Interface?)
